CSAddressBookUI
===============

AddressBook contacts multiple selection

Most of you at least once have been asked to have a multiple selection contact from the Address Book. 
You can find load of answer on stackoverflow telling you what to do and how to use all the Apple Assets.framework.

Few days ago I chose to develop my own ContactPicker same as WhatsApp does. Just shared that here. Hope can help someone.

You can find a pretty simple Sample code to follow. Just drag and drop the CSAddressBookUI framework on your project and present the Nav controller.

NOTE: please don't forget to add MessageUI.framework and AddressBook.framework as well to your project.

I'm planning to provide some other further changes and customizable stuff. Will do in a bit.
Please let me know if you can find any kind of suggestions or issue to report.

iOS allowed: min iOS 5.0.

That's it. Think...
